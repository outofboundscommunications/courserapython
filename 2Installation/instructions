Python Installation Links
Sue BlumenbergTeaching StaffUnit: Installing and Using Python · 4 months ago · Edited
Here are links to websites where you can download Python 2 and the most common Mac and Windows source code editors.

Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Install Python 2, not Python 3. The latest release is 2.7.11, but earlier versions of Python 2 are fine for this course.

Python will already be installed for most Mac and Linux users. You can check the version by typing python at a command prompt.

Python for Windows:

For 32-bit Windows, download the Windows x86 MSI installer.
For 64-bit Windows, download the Windows x86-64 MSI installer.
Be sure to to pick <Add python.exe to Path> during the installation to avoid the message "python is not recognized as an internal or external command". This gives Windows the location of python.exe.

Here is a screenshot:


Notes:

The option to add to Path does not appear in versions earlier than 2.7.8.
This option is not selected by default. if you re-run the exe installation file you can choose to "change python". This then allows you to install the option to specify the path.
If you are on a Mac, you do not need to install Python, but you can use these links if you want to upgrade to the latest version, We recommend using version 2.7.8 or later.

For Mac OS X 10.5, download Mac OS X 32-bit i386/PPC installer.
For Mac OS X 10.6 or later, download Mac OS X 64-bit/32-bit installer.
Do not uninstall the version that came with your operating system.


Notepad++ (Windows text editor): https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.8.8.html

The latest release of Notepad++ is v6.8.8, but if you already have an earlier version installed, this is fine.

TextWrangler (Mac text editor): http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html

TextWrangler 4.5.12 requires OS X 10.6.8 or later (10.7.5, 10.8.5, 10.9.2 or later recommended)

For OS X 10.5, download http://pine.barebones.com/freeware/TextWrangler_3.5.3.dmg
